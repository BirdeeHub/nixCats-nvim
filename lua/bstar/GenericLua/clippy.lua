-- so, my normal mode <leader>y randomly didnt accept any motions.
-- I didnt know it was meant to, because that was my first install of neovim.
-- If that ever happens to you, comment out the normal one, then uncomment this keymap and the function below it.
-- A full purge of ALL previous config files and state installed via pacman fixed it for me,
-- as the pacman config was the one that had that problem and it was infecting this one too.
-- I thought I was cool, but apparently I was doing a workaround to restore default behavior.

-- vim.keymap.set("n", '<leader>y', [[:set opfunc=Yank_to_clipboard<CR>g@]], { silent = true, desc = 'Yank to clipboard (accepts motions)' })

--     silent exec 'let @/=@"'
