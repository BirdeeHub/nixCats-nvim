PLEASE HELP WITH DOCS AND README!!!

Im just trying to get information on the page as best as I can.

The site is autogenerated from the main readme
and the in-editor help in nix/nixCatsHelp
so updates to the help only need to be made here.

Any other contributions and fixes are also welcome!

The core of the code for nixCats, along with the templates and help,
is in the nix directory, and the READMEs within should help explain things somewhat.

Thank you!!!
