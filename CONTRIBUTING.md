PLEASE HELP WITH DOCS AND README!!!

Im just trying to get information on the page as best as I can.

The site is autogenerated from the main readme
and the in-editor help in nixCatsHelp
so updates to the help only need to be made here.

The readme in particular I am welcome to big changes to,
but if you do, make sure the site generator at
[nixCats-doc](https://github.com/BirdeeHub/nixCats-doc) can handle it.

For the readme it just uses pandoc with a github flavored markdown.
If anyone knows how to make the little warning and info
things from github work with pandoc, that would be great too.

The site generation for the in-editor docs will look exactly how it does in the editor,
and links will work.

So feel free to just send any changes to those my way,
I wont make you work with my bespoke nvim-based site-gen, but it works quite well!

Any other contributions and fixes are also welcome!

The core of the code for nixCats, along with the templates and help,
is in the nix directory, and the READMEs within should help explain things somewhat.

Thank you!!!
