PLEASE HELP WITH DOCS AND README!!!

Im just trying to get information on the page as best as I can.

The site is autogenerated from the main readme
and the in-editor help in nixCatsHelp
so updates to the help only need to be made here.

For the readme it just uses pandoc with a github flavored markdown.
If anyone knows how to make the little warning and info
things from github work with pandoc, that would be great too.

Due to needing to work on both github and the site, all links in the readme must be full urls.

The site generation for the in-editor docs will look exactly how it does in the editor,
and helptag links will work.

So feel free to just send any changes to those my way,
I wont make you work with my bespoke nvim-based site-gen, but it works quite well!

Direction:

- help:

The modules are much nicer now that they merge properly.

And you can get the packages from the module to export from your system flake,
which is possibly incorrectly documented at the end of the module help file.

But basically you can grab it from your config set via self in the flake.

Go check in the repl, its there under nixCats.out.packages in the correct config set.
`self.homeConfigurations."<home_config_name>".config."<defaultPackageName>".out.packages."<package_name>"`

I would like to drastically improve the help and templates for modules,
and encourage the two main paths to be module or separate flake.

I would like to phase out the nixExpressionFlakeOutputs template,
(which wont break anyones config who used it, its just a template,
and doing it that way will continue to work as it has)

I feel that providing proper help for these 2 options as a main path of installation
provides a better onboarding path for new users.

They are familliar with modules,
and standalone flakes, but not weird mixes of the two.
And I feel like throwing in the weird mix as an option just confuses people.

I welcome any help in making this happen.

The kickstart-nvim template should remain as is until someone
comes up with a better way to explain the lazy wrapper other than
"grep for this and read about the 10 places its different"

- tests:

I plan to add tests for utils.catsWithDefault under conditions of multiple merges.

I plan to do this in a separate internal flake so as to not add a dependency to the main one.

I will slowly add more after I do that and would love test
contributions once I have a clear place for people to put them.

---

Any other contributions and fixes are also welcome!

The core of the code for nixCats is in the utils and builder directories,
and the READMEs within should help explain things somewhat.

Thank you!!!
