Post to discussions about any debuggers or other things with build steps not on nixpkgs,

so that others may easily import that debugger/lsp/dependency/whatever they've been wanting as well!

The main drawback to using nix for nvim is when the thing is not on nixpkgs and has a hard build step.

So, again, when you figure a derivation out, regardless of what nvim related thing it is, post it to discussions!!!

Basically, there are some debuggers that are on mason and not on nixpkgs and thus do not work on nixOS.
To build them you would need to make an overlay with a derivation for it inside. If you figure it out post the overlay to discussions.

Share your configs based on nixCats! That is all it takes to share an overlay, but also its fun and we all learn!
