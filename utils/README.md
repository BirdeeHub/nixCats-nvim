[nixCats.utils](https://nixCats.org/nixCats_utils.html) is the interface through which the entire `nixCats` library is accessed.

It has no dependencies, or arguments.

It exports the main builder function, and contains functions for creating modules and other flake outputs,
and various other utilities for working with the nix side of `nixCats` that you may want to use.
