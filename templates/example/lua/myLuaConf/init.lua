-- NOTE: register an extra lze handler with the spec_field 'for_cat'
-- that makes enabling an lze spec for a category slightly nicer
require("lze").register_handlers(require('nixCatsUtils.lzUtils').for_cat)

-- NOTE: Register another one from lzextras. This one makes it so that
-- you can set up lsps within lze specs,
-- and trigger lspconfig setup hooks only on the correct filetypes

require("myLuaConf.LSPs")

-- NOTE: we even ask nixCats if we included our debug stuff in this setup! (we didnt)
-- But we have a good base setup here as an example anyway!

-- NOTE: we included these though! Or, at least, the category is enabled.
-- these contain nvim-lint and conform setups.

-- NOTE: I didnt actually include any linters or formatters in this configuration,
-- but it is enough to serve as an example.
