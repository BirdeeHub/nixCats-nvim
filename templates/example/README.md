This directory contains an idiomatic nixCats config using `lze` for lazy loading with a backup downloading method via paq and mason in case you want to load the directory without using nix at all.

While the lazy.nvim wrapper does exist, this template is the suggested way of using nixCats.

Using it this way will have the most simple feel to use, as opposed to dealing with lazy.nvim disabling all plugin loading it doesn't do itself.

There are many ways to use nixCats, and all are correct.

But hopefully this will give you a good idea of how it looks like to use nixCats as your only package manager while on nix,
what it looks like to use something other than lazy.nvim for loading, as well as how to make a config that works with and without nix.
