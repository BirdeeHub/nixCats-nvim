    Any package based on nixCats is a full nixCats.

    This is how to create a brand new config,
    when all you have is a configured nixCats package.
    Using only the override function

    This is akin to the fresh flake template,
    but using the override function.

    all available arguments to override:
    luaPath categoryDefinitions packageDefinitions name
    nixpkgs system extra_pkg_config dependencyOverlays nixCats_passthru;
  '';
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixpkgs-unstable";
    nixCats.url = "github:BirdeeHub/nixCats-nvim";
    nixCats.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
  };
  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, nixCats, ... }@inputs: let
    forSystems = nixpkgs.lib.genAttrs nixpkgs.lib.platforms.all;
    # We could hardcode this but this is nice and good for demonstration as well
    defaultPackageName = "nvim";
  in {
    # packages.${system} = { default = finalPackage, nvim = finalPackage; }
    packages = forSystems (system: let

      # NOTE: we will be using only this 1 package from the nixCats repo from here on.
      # This technique works ANYWHERE you can get a nixCats based package.
      OGpkg = nixCats.packages.${system}.default;
      # NOTE: You could, for example, add the overlay from nixCats to your pkgs in your system flake.nix
      # and then grab pkgs.nixCats in a module and reconfigure this same way.
      # then put it in home.packages instead of exporting from the flake like this.
      # we can even get our utils from it:
      # inherit (OGpkg) utils;
      # no reason to do that though here.

        Welcome to nixCats!
        (short for nix categories)

        This particular package has been
        configured to be ran via
        `videv` or `configNotIncluded` commands.

        While the main package exported by our flake
        bundles its config, this one did not due to wrapRc = false!
        It will look in ~/.config/nvim by default
        but this can be changed in settings to anywhere.
        This is great for iterating on your lua changes as normal.
        When you are done, rebuild and go back to the normal package
        with the bundled config that can be ran via nix run from anywhere!
