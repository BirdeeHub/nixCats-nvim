    A Lua-natic's neovim flake, with extra cats! nixCats!

    This is a showcase of most of the various utils and builders 
    that get exported and how to use them.

    It does not make use of every option, but it uses most.
    see :help nixCats.flake.outputs.exports for the options used here as well as the rest.

    It would export all the same configurations and exported options as the original 
    but with an extra plugin and a new colorscheme.
    Although its wrapRc option is not useful since the lua is not locally present.
    So it does not export the regularCats package.
    The wrapRc setting is mostly useful for fast iteration while editing lua.
    But it restricts the locations in which you may store the flake to the .config directory.

    # If you want your plugin to be loaded by the standard overlay,
    # i.e. if it wasnt on nixpkgs, but doesnt have an extra build step.
    # Then you should name it "plugins-something"
    # If you wish to define a custom build step not handled by nixpkgs,
    # then you should name it in a different format, and deal with that in the
    # overlay defined for custom builds in the overlays directory.
