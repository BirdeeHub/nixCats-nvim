# within your lua, rather than through the nvim package manager's method.
# Use the help, and the example repository https://github.com/BirdeeHub/nixCats-nvim

# It allows for easy adoption of nix,
# while still providing all the extra nix features immediately.
# Configure in lua, check for a few categories, set a few settings,
# output packages with combinations of those categories and settings.

# All the same options you make here will be automatically exported in a form available
# in home manager and in nixosModules, as well as from other flakes.
