      how to import as just the outputs section of the flake, so that you can export
      its outputs with your system outputs

      It is best practice to avoid using the system pkgs and its overlays in this method
      as then you could not output packages for systems not defined in your system flake.
      It creates a new one instead to use, just like the flake template does.

      Call it from your system flake and call it with inputs as arguments.

      In my opinion, this is the best one, but probably not the best one to start with if new to nix.
