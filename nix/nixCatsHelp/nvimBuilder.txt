INTRODUCTION                              *nixCats.flake.nixperts.nvimBuilder*

Wait, why is this code? 
I could not find a better way to incorporate code examples without
just doing this and including more comments than code.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                *nixCats.flake.nixperts.nvimBuilder.arguments*

We will take our arguments from flake.nix, 
and update default values with the new ones.

          # these ones take FUNCTIONS,
          # and those functions return lists of packages.
          # i.e. (_:[]) as a default argument
          # so now you can put categories of them in
          # and they will be sorted like everything else
