Flake Help                                                      *nixCats.flake*

A Lua-natic's neovim flake, with extra cats! nixCats!

This is the documentation for the flake itself.
This flake uses nix for importing plugins, lsps, dependencies, and more,
in place of usual nvim package managers such as packer, lazy or mason.

Everything else is done in a regular lua config style.
Download in flake.nix and then, simply pretend the root of the flake 
is the root of your Lua config. 

*******************************************************
AN IMPORTANT NOTE:

<1> When editing the files within the flake directory,
nix will not package a new file if it isn't staged in git.
run git add before rebuilding it whenever adding a new file.
Using wrapRc = true would mean this also applies to lua files.
Only tracked files will recieve their updates when
rebuilt without git add being ran first. New files need to be added.
*******************************************************

For detecting what was included by 
the flake in your Lua, see:
:help |nixCats|

`stdpath('config')` will still point to `~/.config/<configDirName>`.
But your lua config will be in the store.
This is ok, because most of the reason for a plugin to use
it would be to write to it, and we cant write to store paths anyway. 
You could use `require('nixCats').configDir`,
or `nixCats('nixCats_config_location')`
to get current config directory for your uses, if ever necessary.
It will be present and correct regardless of settings.

However if you did not use nix at all and did not run the setup
function, of course the nixCats plugin wont be there to ask.

The setup function from `require('nixCatsUtils').setup`
will provide a mock nixCats plugin with SOME values
and empty tables to prevent accidental indexing errors.
You could instead do `require('nixCatsUtils').isNixCats` to default to
`vim.fn.stdpath('config')` if all you wanted was this path though.

Keep in mind they will be read-only if in the store!

Flake Inputs:                                            *nixCats.flake.inputs*

If a plugin does not have an extra build step, and are not on nixpkgs,
you may use this format to import them, replacing the fields marked with <>
>nix
    "plugins-<pluginName>" = {
      url = "github:<userName>/<repositoryName>";
      flake = false;
    };
<
More info on flake url syntax at:
https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-flake.html#examples
You may also use this syntax to pin the version of a plugin regardless of if
you ran nix flake update or not.
You may choose the directory, branch, commit, tag, or even directory
imported.

All inputs named in the `plugins-<pluginName>` format will be added to pkgs
at `pkgs.neovimPlugins.<pluginName>` for you to add to your configuration.

If the plugin has a dot `.` character in it's name, you should name it something else.
Because . is not a valid character in an identifier in nix.

The name here only affects the filename of the overall plugin, and should
only affect things like vim.cmd("packadd <filename>") that refer to
the actual filename of the plugin. Usually I would replace it with -
You will then add it to categoryDefinitions later with the NEW name.

If you use this method to import a plugin, and really dont
want to change the filename of the plugin when they have a
dot in their name, you may
swap the call to `(utils.standardPluginOverlay inputs)`
with `(utils.sanitizedPluginOverlay inputs)`
and then `plugins-plugin.name` would become `pkgs.neovimPlugins.plugin-name`
but neovim would see it as `vim.cmd("packadd plugin.name")` still

If they have a build step or are not a plugin, 
i.e. an lsp, or if they are a plugin from a flake,
dont name them in that format.
If they are a plugin from a flake, they can be added directly,
or they may be added as an overlay if offered.
If they are anything else they arent a plugin at all and obviously
should thus not be added as a plugin via plugins-<pluginName>

If they are on nixpkgs, you dont need to put them in inputs,
because you will be able to access them through pkgs.vimPlugins variable.
Most plugins will not require you to use the inputs section due to being on nixpkgs.
But you may still use it to pin the plugin to a specific version.

If you decided not to use utils.sanitizedPluginOverlay
and wanted to do it with utils.standardPluginOverlay:
If in your inputs you had:
>nix
  "plugins-<plugin-name>" = {
    url = "github:<userName>/<repository.name>";
    flake = false;
  };
<
Where you put plugins in your categoryDefinitions, instead of:
>nix
  pkgs.neovimPlugins.<plugin-name>

You would put this:
>nix
  (pkgs.neovimPlugins.<plugin-name>.overrideAttrs { pname = "<plugin.name>"; })
<
overrideAttrs can be used for a lot more than just fixing the name of the
imported plugin. See:
https://ryantm.github.io/nixpkgs/using/overrides/

If they have a build step and are not on nixpkgs,
you will deal with them in overlays/customBuildsOverlay.nix
then import them into a category of the builder. 
Alternatively you may use overrideAttrs as mentioned above instead of an
overlay for these sorts of packages, but this would possibly get messy if the
build step were complex.

Flake Outputs Introduction                              *nixCats.flake.outputs*

With our inputs to our flake taken care of:
First, we take care of importing our utils set from nixCats.
The reason we are doing this now, is so that it can be defined outside of
the utils.eachSystem function, and thus we can export it
without having to include a system variable when we import it somewhere else.

We also define our luaPath, which is the path to be loaded into the store as
your new neovim config directory. (see :help |'rtp'| for the directories
available for you to use!)

We also define our extra_pkg_config, which is used when initializing the
nixpkgs instance that will build your neovim! Its the same one from
pkgs = import nixpkgs { inherit system; overlays = []; config = {}; }
>nix
  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, ... }@inputs: let
    # In the templates, this is inherit (inputs.nixCats) utils;
    utils = import ./nix;
    # path the the store path to be loaded as neovim config directory
    luaPath = "${./.}";
    # used when initializing the nixpkgs instance
    extra_pkg_config = {
      # allowUnfree = true;
    };
<
                                           *nixCats.flake.outputs.getOverlays*
We call flake utils to get system variable for all default systems.
It simply calls the function with each system value, and maps the resulting
set from { mySet = {}; } to { mySet.${system} = {}; }
Many overlays require being accessed via ${system} variable in this manner,
and thus there is a method for handling it in nixCats.

No overlays SHOULD be exported requiring the ${system} variable to access.
However, some are (such as codeium, a free ai plugin) and thus, we will wrap this anyway.
>nix
  inherit (utils.eachSystem nixpkgs.lib.platforms.all (system: let
                  /* utils.eachSystem is just flake-utils.lib.eachSystem */
         /* list of overlays from ./overlays is added to the rest of the list */
    dependencyOverlays = (import ./overlays inputs) ++ [
      # This overlay grabs all the inputs named in the format
      # `plugins-<pluginName>`
      # Once we add this overlay to our nixpkgs, we are able to
      # use `pkgs.neovimPlugins`, which is a set of our plugins.
      (utils.standardPluginOverlay inputs)
      # add any flake overlays here.
      inputs.neorg-overlay.overlays.default
      inputs.lz-n.overlays.default
      # stuff like this is why this part is done this way.
      inputs.codeium.overlays.${system}.default
    ];
    # these overlays will be wrapped with ${system}
    # and we will call the same utils.eachSystem function
    # later on to access them.
  in { inherit dependencyOverlays; })) dependencyOverlays;
<
This will allow us to pass system independent overlays to our module options,
even when importing overlays from improperly formed flakes.

Managing the system variable in combination with overlays
can be one of the hardest parts of flake usage.
This flake resolves our pkgs instance for neovim itself to help with this,
and takes care of passing the correct pkgs instance
to the categoryDefinitions for use in defining your plugins.

ALTERNATIVELY

They could also just be a list of overlays!
>nix
  dependencyOverlays = (import ./overlays inputs) ++ [
    (utils.standardPluginOverlay inputs)
    inputs.neorg-overlay.overlays.default
    inputs.lz-n.overlays.default

    # when other people mess up their overlays by wrapping them,
    # you may instead call this function on their overlay.
    # it will check if it has the system in it.
    # if so, it will call the function with the system
    # and return the desired overlay
    (utils.fixSystemizedOverlay inputs.codeium.overlays
      (system: inputs.codeium.overlays.${system}.default)
    )
  ];
<

                                               *nixCats.flake.outputs.overlays*
The two major things of note in this overlays section.
Regardless of which above method you choose. >nix
  (utils.standardPluginOverlay inputs) # return type: a single overlay
  # and
  (import ./overlays inputs) # type: List of Overlays
<
<1>
-- The first to explain is utils.standardPluginOverlay:
You do not need to edit it to use it.
Usage of this overlay is described in:
:h |nixCats.flake.inputs|
along with its friend, utils.sanitizedPluginOverlay

It takes all the inputs named in the format
`plugins-somepluginname` and makes them into plugins. 
If the plugin doesn't have a build step,
and it wasnt on nixpkgs, then use this method.
Access them to add them to a category of the builder function 
with `pkgs.neovimPlugins.somepluginname`

<2>
-- The second is overlays/customBuildsOverlay.nix:

It is imported via overlays/default.nix above

If you need to interact with one of these overlays, it will be this one.
You should not need to do it much.
overlays/default.nix imports this overlay and any others like it.
see :help |nixCats.flake.nixperts.overlays|

It is used for defining plugins with build steps that 
were not well handled by nixpkgs.
It is passed flake inputs, and super is pkgs.
Define the things within the file. 
Then, access plugins defined there later 
with 'pkgs.nixCatsBuilds.somepluginname'

If you decide you wish to split your customBuildsOverlay up, 
see :help |nixCats.flake.nixperts.overlays|
or look at the overlays/default.nix file.

<IMPORTANT> When defining your overlays, they will be
defined in a SEPARATE LIST named <dependencyOverlays>.
You will need <dependencyOverlays> later.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                            *nixCats.flake.outputs.categories*
Then we define what is in our categories!
This section is a function that takes the package definition for this
particular package as an argument.
The builder will call it with that argument, you may use it.
This allows categoryDefinitions to access their packages categories and settings,
which allows categoryDefinitions to be much more dynamic.

These are the things you can return:
>nix
  categoryDefinitions = { pkgs, settings, categories, name, ... }@packageDef: {
<
<propagatedBuildInputs> 
  a flexible set of categories, each containing internal
  BUILD TIME dependencies. Will also be available to the devShell.

<lspsAndRuntimeDeps>
  a flexible set of categories, each containing LSP's or 
  other internal runtime dependencies such as ctags or debuggers
  these are available to the PATH while within the neovim program.
  this includes the neovim terminal.

<startupPlugins>
  a flexible set of categories, each containing startup plugins.
  Startup plugins are loaded and can be required. 

<optionalPlugins>
  a flexible set of categories, each containing optional plugins.
  Optional plugins need to be added with packadd before being required.
  Use :NixCats pawsible to see the names to use for packadd

<sharedLibraries>
  a flexible set of categories, each containing a derivation for
  a runtime shared library. Will be prepended to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable.

<environmentVariables>
  a flexible set of categories, each containing an ATTRIBUTE SET of 
  EnvironmentVariableName = "EnvironmentVariableValue";

<extraWrapperArgs>
  a flexible set of categories, each containing extra wrapper arguments.
  If you don't know what that is, see here:
github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/build-support/setup-hooks/make-wrapper.sh

<extraLuaPackages>
  a flexible set of categories, each containing FUNCTIONS 
  that return lists of extra Lua packages.
  These functions are the same thing that you would pass to lua.withPackages.
  Is used to populate $LUA_PATH and $LUA_CPATH

<extraPython3Packages> 
  a flexible set of categories, each containing FUNCTIONS
  that return lists of python packages.
  These functions are the same thing that you would pass to python.withPackages.
  You may get the path to this python environment in your lua config via
  vim.g.python3_host_prog
  or run from nvim terminal via :!<packagename>-python3

<extraPython3wrapperArgs>
  the same as extraWrapperArgs but for bundled python3 executable

<optionalLuaPreInit>
  a flexible set of categories, each containing a lua string
  that will be ran before sourcing your init.lua
  Yes it can access nixCats.
  It is not the recommended way to create lua for this flake, 
  but it may be useful in editing flake imports 
  of other already configured setups following the nixCats format.
<optionalLuaAdditions>
  a flexible set of categories, each containing a lua string
  that will be ran after sourcing your init.lua
  Yes it can access nixCats.
  It is not the recommended way to create lua for this flake, 
  but it may be useful in editing flake imports 
  of other already configured setups following the nixCats format.
<bashBeforeWrapper>
  a flexible set of categories, each containing arbitrary bash code
  to run before the wrapper starts within the wrapper's bash environment.
  CAUTION: only use this if you know what you are doing and why you need
  to do it. Whenever possible, use extraWrapperArgs instead.
}

In essence, the contents of each set listed here are filtered
based on the packageDefinitions set you provide, 
where by including categoryname = true; you enable that category.
:help |nixCats.flake.outputs.packageDefinitions|

It will remove duplicate items, so feel free to include the same thing in
multiple categories if it suits your purposes.

It does this recursively. (explained below)
                            *nixCats.flake.outputs.categoryDefinitions.scheme*

If, inside one of these main sets, you had another set,
it would consider that a subcategory, and you could enable it
just like you do with a normal category, by setting a value with the
corresponding attribute path to true in the category
set of |nixCats.flake.outputs.packageDefinitions|.
You can nest them as much as you like, or just have a category that is a
single derivation.

There is a behavior to keep in mind.

If in your categoryDefinitions you had the following:
>nix
    environmentVariables = {
      test = {
        subtest1 = {
          CATTESTVAR = "It worked!";
        };
        subtest2 = {
          CATTESTVAR3 = "It didn't work!";
        };
      };
    };
    extraWrapperArgs = {
      test = [
        '' --set CATTESTVAR2 "It worked again!"''
      ];
    };
<
And in your packageDefinitions set, under categories, you had the following:
>nix
    test = {
      subtest1 = true;
    };
<
you could echo $CATTESTVAR and $CATTESTVAR2 in your terminal to see them.
However you could not echo $CATTESTVAR3.

All items that are not attributes of the parent set will be included
when you enable a subcategory. This includes lists, strings, functions, etc...

However, attributes will not and you must explicitly enable all attributes of
a subcategory if you set even 1 explicitly.

Thus to include CATTESTVAR3, you would have to enable it like so: >nix
    test = {
      subtest1 = true;
      subtest2 = true;
    };
< However, those are all the items in the test category.
So instead we can do this to enable all the subcategories in test. >nix
    test = true;
<
This applies in many situations. Take this one for example.
>nix
    lspsAndRuntimeDeps = {
      neonixdev = {
        inherit (pkgs)
<          nix-doc nil lua-language-server nixd; >nix
      };
    };
    startupPlugins = {
      neonixdev = with pkgs.vimPlugins; [
        neodev-nvim
        neoconf-nvim
      ];
    };

< If you were to put the following in your packageDefinitions: >nix
    neonixdev.nix-doc = true;

< neodev-nvim and neoconf-nvim would still be included.
 However, nil, lua-language-server, and nixd would not be!
 You would need to pick which of those you wanted separately.
 Sometimes this is the desired behavior.
 Sometimes it is not and a list of packages would be better suited.

 You may also use the packageDef variable within categoryDefinitions
 to get access to the set of categories and settings that are being
 used to define the current package being built!
>nix
    themer = with pkgs.vimPlugins;
      (builtins.getAttr packageDef.categories.colorscheme {
          # Theme switcher without creating a new category
          "onedark" = onedark-vim;
          "catppuccin" = catppuccin-nvim;
        }
      );
<
  In addition to all this, if a plugin is defined within a list, it may
  instead be defined within an attribute set that also contains config
  to be ran after sourcing init.lua and optionalLuaAdditions
  to do this, you may use the following syntax in opt or start sections: >nix
    [
      # you may add a plugin to a category list in any of these ways
      { plugin = derivation; config.lua = ""; config.vim = "";}
      { plugin = derivation; config = ""; type = "<viml or lua>"; }
      { plugin = derivation; config = ""; } # defaults to viml
      { plugin = derivation; }
      # all the above options can accept an optional = bool;
      # to override its presence in either startupPlugins or optionalPlugins
      derivation
      # plain derivation does not need to be in a list, but it should be
      # anyway. It could be on its own though and would act as its own
      # category.
    ]
<
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package Generation:                           *nixCats.flake.outputs.packageDefinitions*

generate packages by calling that builder function we just created.
Place them in the packageDefinitions set.

First, pick the set of settings you wish to include.

Then, pass it a set of named boolean values like this:
`{ categoryname1 = true; categoryname2 = false; etc... }`
False may be omitted. True may not.
Only true matters for what plugins will be added.

These categories are defined in the Builder function above 
by placing named lists of plugins in the flexible sets provided.
The category names are the names of those lists. 
Add a new list, then enable the category here.

If you have categories with the same name in 
multiple different sets outlined above in the builder,
all plugins in those categories will be
included when you set "thatname = true;" here.
hence, general = true; will include the general lspsAndDeps category,
as well as the general startupPlugins category.

an example package definition:
>nix
  packageDefinitions = {
    nixCats = { pkgs, ... }: {
      setting = {
        wrapRc = true;
        # nvimSRC = inputs.neovim;
        aliases = [ "viCat" ];
      };
      categories = {
        custom = true;
        gitPlugins = true;
        general = true;
        neonixdev = true;

        # this does not have an associated category of plugins, 
        # but lua can still check for it
        lspDebugMode = false;

        # you could also pass something else and it calls 
        # builtins.toString on it and passes it in as a string
        theBestCat = "says meow!!!";
        # maybe you need to pass a port or path in or something idk.
        # you could :lua print(require('nixCats').theBestCat)
      };
    };
  };
<
You can use the nixCats plugin for the set you define here in your lua
It returns a lua table of the same format.

Settings                                       *nixCats.flake.outputs.settings*

QUICK TIP: wrapRc

The wrapRc option is very useful for testing lua changes.
It removes the need to stage and rebuild to see your lua changes reflected.
You will still need to rebuild when making changes to nix regardless of the
value of wrapRc

However it also means that the lua isn't going run if it isn't in the right
folder, i.e. when installed and ran from github with nix run

If the lua is not in `vim.fn.stdpath('config')`, wrapRc = false will not work.
By default this is `~/.config/nvim` on linux systems, although we can
change `nvim` to whatever we wish via the configDirName setting.

Alternatively, you can set the `unwrappedCfgPath` option to allow the
configuration to be set to an absolute path. You still may want to set
the configDirName option anyway to change the data directories,
or explicitly keep it the same on both so that they share stuff like auths.

The most convenient way to use this is the following:
Make a second identical packageDefinition, but with wrapRc disabled.
Then install both the wrapped one and unwrapped one with different aliases.
When you want to hack in lua, use unwrapped! When you're done, just rebuild
and go back to the wrapped one.

The nixCats main flake.nix file has an example of this with nixCats
and regularCats.

Then, when testing lua changes, you run the other package and have a vanilla
neovim experience, only rebuilding when you install new packages.

When you are satisfied, simply rebuild and go back to using the main package,
as it was the same except for the single option!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Neovim Builder Creation:                        *nixCats.flake.outputs.builder*

Now we define our builder function.
We inherit utils.baseBuilder which is
a function that takes 5 arguments. It is defined in ./nix/builder
Right now we are going to call it with just the first 4 of them. This will
leave us with a function that takes 1 argument.
That argument is the name of the neovim package to be packaged.

1. The path to the lua to include (in the flake, we use the self variable to get
     this path and wrap the lua when wrapRc = true)

2. A set containing:
  The dependencyOverlays set or list,
  extra_pkg_config, nixpkgs, nixCats_passthru, and system so it can
  resolve pkgs and pass it where it needs to go.

3. our function that takes an individual package definition
     and returns a set of categoryDefinitions.

4. our set of packageDefinitions see: |nixCats.flake.outputs.packageDefinitions|

It is now a function that takes a name, and returns your chosen neovim package.
>nix
  # It requires the system variable to build a package.
  utils.eachSystem nixpkgs.lib.platforms.all (system: let
    # create our builder for our exports
    inherit (utils) baseBuilder;
    nixCatsBuilder = baseBuilder luaPath {
      inherit nixpkgs system dependencyOverlays extra_pkg_config;
    } categoryDefinitions packageDefinitions;
    # it can take a name of a package in packageDefinitions
    # and return the package!
    defaultPackage = nixCatsBuilder defaultPackageName;
    # ... rest of the outputs section explained
    # below in :h nixCats.flake.outputs.exports ...

If you use it wrong, you will most likely get this error message:

  The following arguments are accepted:

Flake Exports and Export options               *nixCats.flake.outputs.exports*

They look something like this:
>nix
  # this first section is the outputs we
  # want to wrap with the ${system} variable
  utils.eachSystem nixpkgs.lib.platforms.all (system: let
    # this is the builder (see :h nixCats.flake.outputs.builder above):
    nixCatsBuilder = utils.baseBuilder luaPath {
      inherit nixpkgs system dependencyOverlays extra_pkg_config;
    } categoryDefinitions packageDefinitions;
    # then it takes our categoryDefinitions and packageDefinitions

    # then we build a package to serve as the default one by providing its name.
    defaultPackage = nixCatsBuilder defaultPackageName;

    # this is just for using utils in the following section such as pkgs.mkShell
    # The one used to build neovim is resolved inside the builder
    # and is passed to our categoryDefinitions and packageDefinitions
    pkgs = import nixpkgs { inherit system; };
    # as you can see, "resolve pkgs" does not mean anything fancy.
    # however, with overlays and system variable,
    # sometimes you can get yourself in a loop when
    # doing more advanced things. So this flake takes care of that for you.
    # it will make sure pkgs is passed to the categoryDefinitions and packageDefinitions
  in
  {
    # these outputs will be wrapped with ${system} by utils.eachSystem

    # this will make a package out of each of the packageDefinitions defined above
    # and set the default package to the one passed in here.
    packages = utils.mkAllWithDefault defaultPackage;

    # choose your package for devShell
    # and add whatever else you want in it.
    devShells = {
      default = pkgs.mkShell {
        name = defaultPackageName;
        packages = [ defaultPackage ];
        inputsFrom = [ ];
        shellHook = ''
        '';
      };
    };

  }) // {

    # these outputs will be NOT wrapped with ${system}

    # now we can export some things that can be imported in other
    # flakes, WITHOUT needing to use a system variable to do it.
    # and update them into the rest of the outputs returned by the
    # eachSystem function.

    # this will make an overlay out of each of the packageDefinitions defined
    # and set the default overlay to the one named here.
    overlays = utils.makeOverlays luaPath {
      # we pass in the things to make a pkgs variable to build nvim with later
      inherit nixpkgs dependencyOverlays extra_pkg_config;
      # and also our categoryDefinitions
    } categoryDefinitions packageDefinitions defaultPackageName;

    # we export a nixos module to allow configuration from configuration.nix
    # allows you to either inherit values from your main flake, or start fresh
    nixosModules.default = utils.mkNixosModules {
      inherit dependencyOverlays luaPath defaultPackageName
        categoryDefinitions packageDefinitions nixpkgs;
    };
    # and the same for home manager
    homeModule = utils.mkHomeModules {
      inherit dependencyOverlays luaPath defaultPackageName
        categoryDefinitions packageDefinitions nixpkgs;
    };
    inherit utils;
    inherit (utils) templates;
  };
<

We also export the <utils> set so we can get it easier later,
along with <templates> which are inside it.
The <utils> is also exported by the passthru of all packages based on nixCats
but exporting it separately makes it easier to get again later.

It also contains all the other functions used in creating the format in the
templates, including the main builder!
(see :h |nixCats.flake.outputs.builder| for builder explanation)

In addition to the templates and the builder function, the utils set contains:

<standardPluginOverlay> inputs:
allows for inputs named plugins-something to be
turned into an overlay containing them as plugins automatically

<sanitizedPluginOverlay> inputs:
optional replacement for `utils.standardPluginOverlay`.
If you give it an input named `plugins-foo.bar`
you can get it at `pkgs.neovimPlugins.foo-bar`
and still `packadd foo.bar` because it keeps the folder name the same.
To use, in your overlays section:
Replace `(utils.standardPluginOverlay inputs)`
with `(utils.sanitizedPluginOverlay inputs)`

<fixSystemizedOverlay> overlaysSet: outfunc:
takes 2 arguments.
a set of system-wrapped overlays,
and a function (system: overlays.${system}.<desired_overlay>)
returns the desired overlay, with the system resolved.

<mergeCatDefs> oldCats: newCats:
for merging `categoryDefinitions` and individual packages in `packageDefinitions`,
will recursively update up to the first thing not an attrset.
For our purposes, we do not consider derivations to be attrsets.
It takes 2 functions that return sets and returns
a function which calls them both and merges the result as desired above.

<mergeOverlayLists> oldOverlist: newOverlist: self: super:
for merging lists of overlays together properly
to avoid naming conflict issues.
Takes 2 lists of overlays, returns a single merged overlay.
Merging logic is the same as mergeCatDefs

<safeOversList> { dependencyOverlays, system ? null }:
Simple helper function for mergeOverlayLists
Pass it the inherited `dependencyOverlays`, always recieve a list back.
Then feed it to `mergeOverlayLists`.
If dependencyOverlays is an attrset, system string is required.
If dependencyOverlays is a list, system string is ignored
If invalid type or system, returns an empty list

<mkNixosModules> {
    defaultPackageName = "nixCats";
    luaPath = "${./.}";
    inherit nixpkgs dependencyOverlays
      categoryDefinitions packageDefinitions extra_pkg_config;
};
Will create a nixos module that you can import in configuration.nix
If you do not have a luaPath, you may pass it a keepLua builder
See :help |nixCats.flake.outputs.exports.mkNixosModules|
The packages also export a module with defaultPackageName
set to THEIR package name via their passthru variable using this function.

<mkHomeModules>
The same as mkNixosModules above, but for home manager.

<mkAllWithDefault> package:
makes each package in the packageDefinitions this package was made from
and also a default one out of the one passed in.

<mkAllPackages> package:
makes each package in the packageDefinitions this package was made from

<mkPackages> finalBuilder: packageDefinitions: defaultName:
makes each package in packageDefinitions and also a default one
where finalBuilder is the builder function with all but the name applied

<mkExtraPackages> finalBuilder: packageDefinitions:
mkPackages just calls this and adds a default one.
where finalBuilder is the builder function with all but the name applied

<makeOverlays> luaPath: {
        nixpkgs
        , extra_pkg_config ? {}
        , dependencyOverlays ? null
        , nixCats_passthru ? {}
        , ...
      }@pkgsParams: categoryDefFunction: packageDefinitions:
      defaultName:
makes an overlay for each package and also a default one
These are basically the same as the arguments to utils.baseBuilder
dependencyOverlays may be dependencyOverlays.${system} = [ list of overlays ];
or simply dependencyOverlays = [ list of overlays ];

<makeMultiOverlay> <same args as makeOverlays BUT with the following 2 args INSTEAD of `defaultName`>:
            `importName:` `namesIncList:`
Instead of taking a defaultName, it takes an importName and a list of names.
It will output them in an overlay where they will be accessible by pkgs.${importName}.${name}

<makeOverlaysWithMultiDefault> utils.makeOverlays but the default overlay
uses makeMultiOverlay. So that after adding it, all your packages from packageDefinitions will
be accessible at `pkgs.${defaultPackageName}.${packageName}`
Can be swapped out 1 for 1 with `utils.makeOverlays` if preferred

<easyMultiOverlay> package:
i.e. if you had a package named nvim1 and a package named nvim2,
would output an overlay containing both `pkgs.nvim1` and `pkgs.nvim2`

Takes as its argument only a finished nixCats package.
Utilizes override to avoid wrapping the overlay with ${system} variable.

Slightly different from makeMultiOverlay in that
makeMultiOverlay would output at `pkgs.${importName}.nvim1`
instead of `pkgs.nvim1` like this one does.

<easyMultiOverlayNamespaced> package: importName:
If you had a package named nvim1 and a package named nvim2,
would output an overlay containing
both `pkgs.${importName}.nvim1` and `pkgs.${importName}.nvim2`

Takes as its argument only a finished nixCats package.
Utilizes override to avoid wrapping the overlay with ${system} variable.

identical output to `makeMultiOverlay`

<easyNamedOvers> package:
Same output as makeOverlays except without a default package.
i.e. if you had a package named nvim1 and a package named nvim2,
would make an overlay named nvim1 and an overlay named nvim2

Takes as its argument only a finished nixCats package.
Utilizes override to avoid wrapping the overlay with ${system} variable

<eachSystem> systems: f:
just flake-utils.lib.eachSystem copied here to remove the final input outside
of nixpkgs itself.

<bySystem> systems: f:
similar to flake-utils.lib.eachSystem but for only 1 variable. If used for the
whole outputs section instead of eachSystem, it would add the
`${system}` to the start like `${system}.packages.default` and not
`packages.${system}.default` so instead it is used for only a single output like:
`{ packages = utils.bySystem nixpkgs.lib.platforms.all (system: { default = ...; }) }`

It is the same thing as `nixpkgs.lib.genAttrs`, renamed so that people know
how to use it.

<mkLuaInline> luaCode:
This helper can be used in the `packageDefinitions` set in order to write
unescaped lua code into the nixCats plugin.

For example, if `settings.wrapRc = false;` and `settings.unwrappedCfgPath`
is NOT set, nixCats uses this function to make
your config path default to the value of:
`nixCats_config_location = utils.mkLuaInline "vim.fn.stdpath('config')"`


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nix OS Module                     *nixCats.flake.outputs.exports.mkNixosModules*
                                  *nixCats.flake.outputs.exports.mkHomeModules*

We create the module by exporting the following in our flake outputs.
More information on the modules can be found at :h |nixCats.module|

<mkNixosModules> {
    defaultPackageName = "nixCats";
    luaPath = "${./.}";
    inherit nixpkgs dependencyOverlays
      categoryDefinitions packageDefinitions extra_pkg_config;
};

<mkHomeModules> {
    defaultPackageName = "nixCats";
    luaPath = "${./.}";
    inherit nixpkgs dependencyOverlays
      categoryDefinitions packageDefinitions extra_pkg_config;
};

dependencyOverlays may be dependencyOverlays.${system} = [ list of overlays ];
or simply dependencyOverlays = [ list of overlays ];

IMPORTANT
By default, the module inherits your flake or nixExpressionFlakeOutputs nixpkgs object,
and its overlays, and everything else.
It will still inherit your system overlays and config set and system value,
but your system will not inherit overlays added to the nixCats module option.

More information on the modules can be found at :h |nixCats.module|
