Now that you are within an editor outfitted to edit a flake,
you can access the help for nixCats by typing :help nixCats and choosing one
of the options suggested by the auto-complete.

Now that you have access to the help and a nix lsp, to get started,
first exit neovim. (but not the nix shell!)

In a terminal, navigate to your nvim directory and run the following command:
>bash
  nix flake init -t github:BirdeeHub/nixCats-nvim
<
This will create an empty version of flake.nix for you to fill in,
along with an empty overlays directory for any custom builds from source
required, if any. It will directly import the builder, utils, and
help from nixCats-nvim itself, keeping your configuration clean.

Re-enter the nixCats nvim version by typing nvim . and take a look!
Reference the help and nixCats-nvim itself as a guide for importing your setup.

You add plugins to the flake.nix, call the default setup function in your lua,
and use lspconfig to set up lsps. You may optionally choose to set up a plugin
only when that particular category is enabled in the current package.
for how to check, see :h `nixCats`

It is a similar process to migrating to a new neovim plugin manager.

You are, of course, free to clone or fork nixCats-nvim instead if you prefer.

Use the help and nixCats-nvim itself as an example.
The help will still be accessible in your version of the editor.

When you have your plugins added, you can build it using 'nix build' and it
will build to a result directory, or 'nix profile install' to install it to your
profile. Make sure you run 'git add .' first as anything not staged will not
be added to the store and thus not be findable by either nix or neovim.
See nix documentation on how to use these commands further at:
https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/command-ref/new-cli/nix

When you have a working version, you can begin to explore the many
options made available for importing your new nix neovim configuration
into a nix system or home manager configuration.
There are many, thanks to the virtues of the category scheme of this flake.

It is made to be customized into your own portable nix neovim distribution 
with as many options as you wish, while requiring you to leave the normal
nvim configuration scheme as little as possible.

Think of it like, a build-your-own nixVim kit that doesn't
require you to know all about nix right away to get most of the benefits.

Further info:

There are several other templates.
They are designed to be used as examples for
importing versions of your nixCats into another existing configuration.

<attention>
If you already have a system flake, you probably want to configure
your neovim as a module. There are some templates below that you should
not import directly into your flake, but should instead take a look at
and use as an example of what to do.

Modules have the same configuration options as the flake version.

Therefore, it is VERY easy to begin with the flake version,
have it separate while you work with it, and then either
leave it separate as a flake, or copy your configuration
into the module version.

In fact, you could even copy the nixCats into your
main configuration's flake inputs, then, wherever you want,
recreate the entire outputs set of the flake from just the utils set.

I actually use that method as it allows me to not only install multiple
different customized versions, but also return them as standalone
packages from my system flake. The point is, there are probably about as many
ways to import nixCats as there are ways to configure nvim itself.

These templates are not suited to being initialized directly in your
nvim config folder like the first one was.
They are minimal examples of how to import nixCats in different ways.

<->
A short introduction to the main templates
and examples of some auto-exported options:

This one shows the options that get exported as a home manager module
It also shows how to import the module.
It is not a complete home manager flake in and of itself.
>bash
  nix flake init -t github:BirdeeHub/nixCats-nvim#homeModule
<
This one shows the options that get exported as a nixOS module
It also shows how to import the module.
It is not a complete nixOS flake in and of itself.
>bash
  nix flake init -t github:BirdeeHub/nixCats-nvim#nixosModule
<
This next one shows, within another flake, how to import 
only some parts of other nixCats and overwrite or add others.
You could use it, for example, to import just the overlays from another nixCats
without having to copy paste them into your own version.
>bash
  nix flake init -t github:BirdeeHub/nixCats-nvim#mergeFlakeWithExisting
<
When you make categories in your flake.nix,
and then check them in lua, that creates your primary set of options.

You can modify ANYTHING within a flake that imports your nixCats,
however, usually, all you would need to do is choose a package you defined,
or put different values in categories, because you can check the categories
set within your lua and react to them.

You could more or less build your own nixVim in your flake by choosing
your categories carefully and referring to them within your lua.
And then the options would get automatically exported
for any way a nix user may want to set them.

This is what it looks like to choose a specific package
or choose new categories within another flake that imports yours.
Yours will look slightly different, because you will 
probably choose to make different categories than I did.
And you will probably also choose different package names.

You could run nix build on a standalone flake.nix containing this.
It could produce any of 4 configured neovim packages.
