Flake Help                                                      *nixCats.flake*

A Lua-natic's neovim flake, with extra cats! nixCats!

This is the documentation for the flake itself.
This flake uses nix for importing plugins, lsps, dependencies, and more,
in place of usual nvim package managers such as packer, lazy or mason.

Everything else is done in a regular lua config style.
Download in flake.nix and then, simply pretend the root of the flake 
is the root of your Lua config. 

*******************************************************
TWO IMPORTANT NOTES:

<1> YOU CANNOT LAUNCH THIS VIA nvim COMMAND
      IT HAS THE NAME OF THE PACKAGE YOU SET,
      AND WHATEVER ALIASES YOU GAVE IT.
      This is due to the ability to install multiple nvims via home manager
      or per single user on nixos.

<2> When editing the files within the flake directory,
nix will not package a new file if it isn't staged in git.
run git add before rebuilding it whenever adding a new file.
Using wrapRc = true would mean this also applies to lua files.
In fact, when wrapRc = true, even changes within a lua file
will not be reflected unless you run git add.
*******************************************************

Related:
For detecting what was included by 
the flake in your Lua, see:
:help `nixCats`

`stdpath('config')` will still point to ~/.config/<configDirName>.
But your lua config will be in the store.
This is ok, because most of the reason for a plugin to use
it would be to find something outside the directory. 
Inside is mostly handled by vim.
You could use vim.g.configdir,
which I make when I load the config folder,
to get current config directory for your uses, if ever necessary.
It will be present and correct regardless of settings.
You could also use debug.getinfo(1, "S").source:sub(2) or something similar.
Keep in mind they will be read-only if in the store!

Flake Inputs:                                            *nixCats.flake.inputs*

If they dont have an extra build step, and are not on nixpkgs,
you may use this format to import them, replacing the fields marked with <>
>nix
    "plugins-<pluginName>" = {
      url = "github:<userName>/<repositoryName>";
      flake = false;
    };
<
If the plugin has a dot in it's name, you should name it something else.
The name here only affects the filename of the overall plugin, and should
only affect things like vim.cmd("packadd <filename>") that refer to
the actual filename of the plugin. Usually I would replace it with _
You will then add it to categoryDefinitions later with the NEW name.
You may also use this to pin the version of a plugin.
More info on flake url syntax at:
https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-flake.html#examples


If they have a build step or are not a plugin, 
i.e. an lsp, dont name them in that format.

If they are on nixpkgs, you dont necessarily need to put them in inputs,
because you will be able to access them through pkgs.vimPlugins variable later.

Most plugins will not require you to use this section due to being on nixpkgs.
But you may still use it to pin the plugin to a specific version.

Context for later:

If they have a build step, you will deal with them in overlays/customBuildsOverlay.nix
then import them into a category of the builder. 
(assuming nixpkgs hasn't already done it!!)

If they are not a plugin:
You will import them into a category of the builder under lspsAndDeps, 
unless they are for build time, then put them under propagatedBuildInputs

Flake Outputs Introduction                              *nixCats.flake.outputs*

With our inputs to our flake taken care of:
First, we take care of importing our utils set.
The reason we are doing this now, is so that it can be defined outside of
the flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem function, and thus we can export it
without having to include a system variable when we import it somewhere else.
>nix
  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, flake-utils, ... }@inputs: let
    utils = (import ./nix/utils).utils;
    luaPath = "${./.}";
    extra_pkg_config = {
      # allowUnfree = true;
    };
<
We call flake utils to get system variable for all default systems.
It simply calls the function with each system value, and maps the resulting
set from { mySet = {}; } to { mySet.${system} = {}; }
Many overlays require being accessed via ${system} variable in this manner,
and thus there is a method for handling it in nixCats.
>nix
  system_resolved = flake-utils.lib.eachSystem flake-utils.lib.allSystems (system: let
    # see :help nixCats.flake.outputs.overlays
    dependencyOverlays = (import ./overlays inputs) ++ [
      # This overlay grabs all the inputs named in the format
      # `plugins-<pluginName>`
      # Once we add this overlay to our nixpkgs, we are able to
      # use `pkgs.neovimPlugins`, which is a set of our plugins.
      (utils.standardPluginOverlay inputs)
      # add any flake overlays here.
      inputs.nixd.overlays.default
    ];
    # these overlays will be wrapped with ${system}
    # and we will call the same flake-utils function
    # later on to access them.
  in { inherit dependencyOverlays; });
  inherit (system_resolved) dependencyOverlays;
<
This will allow us to pass system independent overlays to our module options.
And also allow more outputs to be outside of the 2nd and final flake utils,
allowing us to avoid mapping certain things in this manner.

Managing the system variable in combination with overlays
can be one of the harder parts of flake usage.
This flake resolves our pkgs instance later to help with this, and takes care
of passing the correct pkgs instance to the categoryDefinitions for use in
defining your plugins.

                                               *nixCats.flake.outputs.overlays*
We now define our overlays.
We have 2 main overlays to discuss.

<1>
-- The first is utils.standardPluginOverlay:
You do not need to edit it to use it.

It takes all the inputs named in the format
'plugins-somepluginname' and makes them into plugins. 
If the plugin doesn't have a build step,
and it wasnt on nixpkgs, then use this method.
Access them to add them to a category of the builder function 
with 'pkgs.neovimPlugins.somepluginname'

<2>
-- The second is overlays/customBuildsOverlay.nix:

It is imported via overlays/default.nix above

If you need to interact with one of these overlays, it will be this one.
You should not need to do it much.
overlays/default.nix imports this overlay and any others like it.
see :help `nixCats.flake.nixperts.overlays`

It is used for defining plugins with build steps that 
were not well handled by nixpkgs.
It is passed flake inputs, and super is pkgs.
Define the things within the file. 
Then, access plugins defined there later 
with 'pkgs.nixCatsBuilds.somepluginname'

If you decide you wish to split your customBuildsOverlay up, 
see :help `nixCats.flake.nixperts.overlays`
or look at the overlays/default.nix file.

<IMPORTANT> When defining your overlays, they will be
defined in a SEPARATE LIST named <dependencyOverlays>.
You will need <dependencyOverlays> later.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                            *nixCats.flake.outputs.categories*
Then we define what is in our categories!
This section is a function that takes the package definition for this
particular package as an argument.
The builder will call it with that argument, you may use it.
This allows categoryDefinitions to access their packages categories and settings,
which allows categoryDefinitions to be much more dynamic.

These are the things you can return:
>nix
  categoryDefinitions = { pkgs, settings, categories, name, ... }@packageDef: {
<
<propagatedBuildInputs> 
  a flexible set of categories, each containing internal
  BUILD TIME dependencies. Will also be available to the devShell.

<lspsAndRuntimeDeps>
  a flexible set of categories, each containing LSP's or 
  other internal runtime dependencies such as ctags or debuggers
  these are available to the PATH while within the neovim program.
  this includes the neovim terminal.

<startupPlugins>
  a flexible set of categories, each containing startup plugins.
  Startup plugins are loaded and can be required. 

<optionalPlugins>
  a flexible set of categories, each containing optional plugins.
  Optional plugins need to be added with packadd before being required.

<sharedLibraries>
  a flexible set of categories, each containing a derivation for
  a runtime shared library. Will be prepended to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable.

<environmentVariables>
  a flexible set of categories, each containing an ATTRIBUTE SET of 
  EnvironmentVariableName = "EnvironmentVariableValue";

<extraWrapperArgs>
  a flexible set of categories, each containing extra wrapper arguments.
  If you don't know what that is, see here:
github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/build-support/setup-hooks/make-wrapper.sh

<extraLuaPackages>
  a flexible set of categories, each containing FUNCTIONS 
  that return lists of extra Lua packages.
  These functions are the same thing that you would pass to lua.withPackages.
  Is used to populate $LUA_PATH and $LUA_CPATH

<extraPython3Packages> 
  a flexible set of categories, each containing FUNCTIONS
  that return lists of python packages.
  These functions are the same thing that you would pass to python.withPackages.
  You may get the path to this python environment in your lua config via
  vim.g.python3_host_prog
  or run from nvim terminal via :!<packagename>-python3

<extraPython3wrapperArgs>
  the same as extraWrapperArgs but for bundled python3 executable

  <optionalLuaAdditions>* It can also take 
    a flexible set of categories, each containing a lua string
    that will be ran after sourcing your init.lua
    Yes it can access nixCats.
    It is not the recommended way to create lua for this flake, 
    but it may be useful in some edge cases of editing flake imports 
    of other already configured setups following the nixCats format.
    Therefore, I have included this option.
}

In essence, the contents of each set listed here are filtered
based on the packageDefinitions set you provide, 
where by including categoryname = true; you enable that category.
:help `nixCats.flake.outputs.packageDefinitions`

It will remove duplicate items, so feel free to include the same thing in
multiple categories if it suits your purposes.

It does this recursively. (explained below)
                            *nixCats.flake.outputs.categoryDefinitions.scheme*

If, inside one of these main sets, you had another set,
it would consider that a subcategory, and you could enable it
just like you do with a normal category, by setting a value with the
corresponding attribute path to true in the category
set of `nixCats.flake.outputs.packageDefinitions`.
You can nest them as much as you like, or just have a category that is a
single derivation.

There is a behavior to keep in mind.

If in your categoryDefinitions you had the following:
>nix
    environmentVariables = {
      test = {
        subtest1 = {
          CATTESTVAR = "It worked!";
        };
        subtest2 = {
          CATTESTVAR3 = "It didn't work!";
        };
      };
    };
    extraWrapperArgs = {
      test = [
        '' --set CATTESTVAR2 "It worked again!"''
      ];
    };
<
And in your packageDefinitions set, under categories, you had the following:
>nix
    test = {
      subtest1 = true;
    };
<
you could echo $CATTESTVAR and $CATTESTVAR2 in your terminal to see them.
However you could not echo $CATTESTVAR3.

All items that are not attributes of the parent set will be included
when you enable a subcategory. This includes lists, strings, functions, etc...

However, attributes will not and you must explicitly enable all attributes of
a subcategory if you set even 1 explicitly.

Thus to include CATTESTVAR3, you would have to enable it like so: >nix
    test = {
      subtest1 = true;
      subtest2 = true;
    };
< However, those are all the items in the test category.
So instead we can do this to enable all the subcategories in test. >nix
    test = true;
<
This applies in many situations. Take this one for example.
>nix
    lspsAndRuntimeDeps = {
      neonixdev = {
        inherit (pkgs)
<          nix-doc nil lua-language-server nixd; >nix
      };
    };
    startupPlugins = {
      neonixdev = with pkgs.vimPlugins; [
        neodev-nvim
        neoconf-nvim
      ];
    };

< If you were to put the following in your packageDefinitions: >nix
    neonixdev.nix-doc = true;

< neodev-nvim and neoconf-nvim would still be included.
 However, nil, lua-language-server, and nixd would not be!
 You would need to pick which of those you wanted separately.
 Sometimes this is the desired behavior.
 Sometimes it is not and a list of packages would be better suited.

 You may also use the packageDef variable within categoryDefinitions
 to get access to the set of categories and settings that are being
 used to define the current package being built!
>nix
    themer = with pkgs.vimPlugins;
      (builtins.getAttr packageDef.categories.colorscheme {
          # Theme switcher without creating a new category
          "onedark" = onedark-vim;
          "catppuccin" = catppuccin-nvim;
        }
      );
<
  In addition to all this, if a plugin is defined within a list, it may
  instead be defined within an attribute set that also contains config
  to be ran before sourcing init.lua (nixCats, however is still accessible)
  to do this, you may use the following syntax in opt or start sections: >nix
    { plugin = derivation; config.vim = ""; config.lua = ""; }
<
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package Generation:                           *nixCats.flake.outputs.packageDefinitions*

generate packages by calling that builder function we just created.
Place them in the packageDefinitions set.

First, pick the set of settings you wish to include.

Then, pass it a set of named boolean values like this:
{ categoryname1 = true; categoryname2 = false; etc... }
False may be omitted. True may not be omitted.
Only true matters for what plugins will be added.

These categories are defined in the Builder function above 
by placing named lists of plugins in the flexible sets provided.
The category names are the names of those lists. 
Add a new list, then enable the category here.

If you have categories with the same name in 
multiple different sets outlined above in the builder,
all plugins in those categories will be
included when you set "thatname = true;" here.
hence, general = true; will include the general lspsAndDeps category,
as well as the general startupPlugins category.

an example package definition:
>nix
  packageDefinitions = {
    nixCats = { pkgs, ... }: {
      setting = {
        wrapRc = true;
        # nvimSRC = inputs.neovim;
        aliases = [ "viCat" ];
      };
      categories = {
        custom = true;
        gitPlugins = true;
        general = true;
        neonixdev = true;

        # this does not have an associated category of plugins, 
        # but lua can still check for it
        lspDebugMode = false;

        # you could also pass something else and it calls 
        # builtins.toString on it and passes it in as a string
        theBestCat = "says meow!!!";
        # maybe you need to pass a port or path in or something idk.
        # you could :lua print(require('nixCats').theBestCat)
      };
    };
  };
<
You can require('nixCats') for the set you define here in your lua
It returns a lua table of the same format.

see :help `nixCats`

For more nuances on enabling categories and subcategories, see above at
:help `nixCats.flake.outputs.categoryDefinitions.scheme`

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Settings                                       *nixCats.flake.outputs.settings*

These are the defaults:
>nix
    default_settings = {
      # YOU ARE IN CHARGE OF MAKING SURE THESE ALIASES DO NOT COLLIDE WITH
      # ANYTHING ELSE
      # [ "takes" "a" "list" "of" "strings" "and" "makes" "an" "alias" "for" "each" ];
      aliases = null;
      viAlias = false;
      vimAlias = false;

      # and the rest:
      withNodeJs = false;
      withRuby = true;
      extraName = "";
      withPython3 = true;
      # unsets PYTHONSAFEPATH variable.
      # Can cause issues with reproducibility,
      # can fix some stuff
      disablePythonSafePath = false;

      # do you want to package the lua from this flake in the store?
      # or would you rather it just read it in your .config/<configDirName>?
      # nixCats and this help will work either way.
      wrapRc = true;

      # What should the name of the folder within standard directories
      # i.e. .config, .local/share, .local/state, .cache, etc... be?
      # This option is very useful when you want 
      # to clone an unwrapped config straight to the .config dir.
      # It is also helpful to prevent other nvim packages sharing data folders.
      # see :help `$NVIM_APPNAME`
      configDirName = "nvim";

      # These 2 options are useful for when you want to allow your dev shells
      # to override things such as lsps and shared libraries that you have
      # already in your configuration.
      suffix-path = false;
      # causes lspsAndDeps to be added to the END of
      # PATH instead of the start
      suffix-LD = false;
      # causes sharedLibraries to be added to the END of
      # LD_LIBRARY_PATH instead of the start

      ### CAUTION: These next 2 options must be the same
      # for ALL nvim packages that you wish to have simultaneously installed.

      # use this to pin a specific neovim version.
      # This one will specify the base neovim derivation to use.
      neovim-unwrapped = null;
      # This one will just override the src value of the neovim in nixpkgs
      # import it in flake inputs with flake = false,
      nvimSRC = null;
    };
<

QUICK TIP: wrapRc

The wrapRc option is very useful for testing lua changes.
It removes the need to stage and rebuild to see your lua changes reflected.
You will still need to rebuild when making changes to nix regardless of the
value of wrapRc

However it also means that the lua isn't going run if it isn't in the right
folder, i.e. when installed and ran from github with nix run

If the lua is not in `vim.fn.stdpath('config')`, wrapRc = false will not work.
By default this is `~/.config/nvim` on linux systems, although we can
change `nvim` to whatever we wish via the configDirName setting.

The best way to use the wrapRc option is to symlink the correct
.config directory to wherever your neovim directory in your
nix config is.

Then, make a second identical packageDefinition, but with wrapRc
disabled. The nixCats main flake.nix file has an example of this with nixCats
and regularCats.

Then, when testing lua changes, you run the other package and have a vanilla
neovim experience, only rebuilding when you install new packages.

When you are satisfied, simply rebuild and go back to using the main package,
as it was the same except for the single option!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Neovim Builder Creation:                        *nixCats.flake.outputs.builder*

Now we define our builder function.
We inherit utils.baseBuilder which is
a function that takes 5 arguments. It is defined in ./nix/builder
Right now we are going to call it with just the first 4 of them. This will
leave us with a function that takes 1 argument.
That argument is the name of the neovim package to be packaged.

1. The path to the lua to include (in the flake, we use the self variable to get
     this path and wrap the lua when wrapRc = true)

2. A set containing:
  The dependencyOverlays set, extra_pkg_config, nixpkgs, and system so it can
  resolve pkgs and pass it where it needs to go.

3. our function that takes an individual package definition
     and returns a set of categoryDefinitions.

4. our set of packageDefinitions see: `nixCats.flake.outputs.packageDefinitions`

It is now a function that takes a name, and returns your chosen neovim package.
>nix
  flake-utils.lib.eachSystem flake-utils.lib.allSystems (system: let
    inherit (utils) baseBuilder;
    customPackager = baseBuilder luaPath {
      inherit nixpkgs system dependencyOverlays extra_pkg_config;
    } categoryDefinitions;
    nixCatsBuilder = customPackager packageDefinitions;
<
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flake Exports and Export options               *nixCats.flake.outputs.exports*

The main thing you may need to do in this section is
to change the default package name to whatever the name of
your default packageDefinition of choice is.

for information on how to use these options when importing your nixCats flake,
see :help `nixCats.installation_options`

They look like this:
>nix
    # see :help nixCats.flake.outputs.exports
  flake-utils.lib.eachSystem flake-utils.lib.allSystems (system: let
    # this is how we use the builder:

    # first it needs a path to the lua to include

    # it takes a set with nixpkgs and system and our overlays
    # so that it can internally resolve pkgs variable
    # and avoid issues with system variable in module options for you.

    # then it takes our categoryDefinitions and packageDefinitions

    # then in the next section, we apply the names as the final input
    inherit (utils) baseBuilder;
    customPackager = baseBuilder luaPath {
      inherit nixpkgs system dependencyOverlays extra_pkg_config;
    } categoryDefinitions;
    nixCatsBuilder = customPackager packageDefinitions;

    # this is just for using utils in the following section such as pkgs.mkShell
    # The one used to build neovim is resolved inside the builder
    # and is passed to our categoryDefinitions and packageDefinitions
    pkgs = import nixpkgs { inherit system; };
    # as you can see, "resolve pkgs" does not mean anything fancy.
    # however, with overlays and system variable,
    # sometimes you can get yourself in a loop when
    # doing more advanced things. So this flake takes care of that for you.
    # it will make sure pkgs is passed to the categoryDefinitions and packageDefinitions
  in
  {
    # these outputs will be wrapped with ${system} by flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem

    # this will make a package out of each of the packageDefinitions defined above
    # and set the default package to the one named here.
    packages = utils.mkPackages nixCatsBuilder packageDefinitions "nixCats";

    # choose your package for devShell
    # and add whatever else you want in it.
    devShells = {
      default = pkgs.mkShell {
        name = defaultPackageName;
        packages = [ (nixCatsBuilder defaultPackageName) ];
        inputsFrom = [ ];
        shellHook = ''
        '';
      };
    };

    # To choose settings and categories from the flake that calls this flake.
    # and you export overlays so people dont have to redefine stuff.
    inherit customPackager;
  }) // {

    # these outputs will be NOT wrapped with ${system}

    # now we can export some things that can be imported in other
    # flakes, WITHOUT needing to use a system variable to do it.
    # and update them into the rest of the outputs returned by the
    # eachDefaultSystem function.

    # this will make an overlay out of each of the packageDefinitions defined above
    # and set the default overlay to the one named here.
    overlays = utils.makeOverlays luaPath {
      # we pass in the things to make a pkgs variable to build nvim with later
      inherit nixpkgs dependencyOverlays extra_pkg_config;
      # and also our categoryDefinitions
    } categoryDefinitions packageDefinitions defaultPackageName;

    # this will make an overlay out of each of the packageDefinitions defined above
    # and set the default overlay to the one named here.
    overlays = utils.makeOverlays luaPath {
      # we pass in the things to make a pkgs variable to build nvim with later
      inherit nixpkgs dependencyOverlays extra_pkg_config;
      # and also our categoryDefinitions
    } categoryDefinitions packageDefinitions defaultPackageName;

    # we export a nixos module to allow configuration from configuration.nix
    nixosModules.default = utils.mkNixosModules {
      defaultPackageName = "nixCats";
      inherit dependencyOverlays luaPath
        categoryDefinitions packageDefinitions nixpkgs;
    };
    # and the same for home manager
    homeModule = utils.mkHomeModules {
      defaultPackageName = "nixCats";
      inherit dependencyOverlays luaPath
        categoryDefinitions packageDefinitions nixpkgs;
    };
    inherit utils categoryDefinitions dependencyOverlays packageDefinitions;
    inherit (utils) templates baseBuilder;
    keepLuaBuilder = utils.baseBuilder luaPath;
  };
<

First, we export all the packages in our package definitions
as packages and overlays using our utilities, and define a devShell.

Now for the required exports for nix integration options.
They allow you to always export all of the same customization options to new
flakes as the original one has, but for your own flake.

First, <customPackager>. This would allow you to choose what
settings and categories you wanted in a flake that imports this flake,
without needing to redefine anything else.

Then <dependencyOverlays>.
These are all the overlays that you imported.
You may use utils.mergeOverlayLists to incorporate overlays 
from other nixCats flakes without worrying about naming conflicts.

Then <categoryDefinitions>
The function where you set up your categories in flake.nix
This allows importing flakes to do a lot less copy pasting.

Then <packageDefinitions>
The set where you chose categories and settings for each package.
This allows importing flakes to do a lot less copy pasting.

<mkNixosModules> {
    defaultPackageName = "nixCats";
    luaPath = "${./.}";
    inherit nixpkgs dependencyOverlays
      categoryDefinitions packageDefinitions;
};
Pass this set into utils.mkNixosModules and choose a defaultPackageName.
It will create a nixos module that you can import in configuration.nix
and will provide all the same import options as the usual flake import would
provide. If you do not have a luaPath, you may pass it a keepLua builder
See :help `nixCats.flake.outputs.exports.mkNixosModules`

<mkHomeModules>
The same as mkNixosModules above, but for home manager.


Then last, the <utils> set, which we imported from ./builder/utils.nix
We export the <utils> set, along with some items inside it.
Those are <templates> and <baseBuilder>
Then we also define a <keepLuaBuilder>, which is a <baseBuilder> with our config path
passed into it.

In total, the <utils> set contains 11 functions and then the templates set.

First, the ones mentioned above.
Then, we also have:

<mkPackages> finalBuilder: packageDefinitions: defaultName:
makes each package and also a default one
<mkExtraPackages> finalBuilder: packageDefinitions:
same as mkPackages but without the default one

<makeOverlays> luaPath: {
        nixpkgs
        , extra_pkg_config ? {}
        , dependencyOverlays ? null
        , nixCats_passthru ? {}
        , ...
      }@pkgsParams: categoryDefFunction: packageDefinitions:
      defaultName:
makes an overlay for each package and also a default one
These are basically the same as the arguments to utils.baseBuilder

<standardPluginOverlay> inputs:
allows for inputs named plugins-something to be
turned into an overlay containing them as plugins automatically

In addition to those, there is also 5 convenience functions:

<mergeCatDefs> oldCats: newCats:
for merging category definitions (and individual packages in packageDefinitions),
will recursively update up to the first thing not an attrset.
For our purposes, we do not consider derivations to be attrsets.

<mergeOverlayLists> oldOverlist: newOverlist: self: super: let
for merging lists of overlays like those in otherOverlays in a way 
that updates to avoid naming conflicts between overlays in different nixCats flakes imported.
within overlays that are sets, will recursively update until
a derivation, or something not a set is reached.

<mkDefaultOverlay> finalBuilder: defaultName:
<mkExtraOverlays> finalBuilder: packageDefinitions:
which when combined with // make up mkOverlays

<mkMultiOverlay> <same args as makeOverlays but with the following 2 args instead of defaultName>:
            importName: namesIncList:
Instead of taking a defaultName, it takes an importName and a list of names.
It will output them in an overlay where they will be accessible by pkgs.${importName}.${name}

Nix OS Module                     *nixCats.flake.outputs.exports.mkNixosModules*
                                  *nixCats.flake.outputs.exports.mkHomeModules*

We create the module by exporting the following in our flake outputs.

<mkNixosModules> {
    defaultPackageName = "nixCats";
    luaPath = "${./.}";
    inherit nixpkgs dependencyOverlays
      categoryDefinitions packageDefinitions;
};

<mkHomeModules> {
    defaultPackageName = "nixCats";
    luaPath = "${./.}";
    inherit nixpkgs dependencyOverlays
      categoryDefinitions packageDefinitions;
};

where dependencyOverlays is a set of system names
with lists of overlays in each item. Such that
the lists would be accessed via dependencyOverlays.${system}

If you do not have a luaPath, you may pass it a keepLua builder.
utils.mkNixosModules exports a nixos module with the following options,
and utils.mkHomeModules exports a home-manager module with the SAME EXACT options
as the nixos module has for system, but for the user managed by home-manager.

            recursively updating all non-attrset values,

          VERY IMPORTANT when setting aliases for each package,
          they must not be the same as ANY other neovim package for that user.
          YOU MAY NOT ALIAS TO NVIM ITSELF
          It will cause a build conflict.
          again, YOU MAY NOT ALIAS TO NVIM ITSELF

          You also cannot install nixCats via
          multiple nixCats modules from different repos per user.
          This should not be an issue as a single module can output multiple packages.

          You can have as many nixCats installed per user as you want,
          as long as you obey those rules.
          This is a big step up from only being able to have 1 neovim
          at all per user, so excuse me for the inconvenience.

          for information on the values you may return,
          see :help nixCats.flake.outputs.settings
          and :help nixCats.flake.outputs.categories

I have condensed it here, but notice at the end it outputs
all the same options for each user when in a nixosModule as well?
