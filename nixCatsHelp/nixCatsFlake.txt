Flake Help                                                      *nixCats.flake*

A Lua-natic's neovim flake, with extra cats! nixCats!

This is the documentation for the flake itself.
This flake uses nix for importing plugins, lsps, dependencies, and more,
in place of usual nvim package managers such as packer, lazy or mason.

Everything else is done in a regular lua config style.
Download in flake.nix and then, simply pretend the root of the flake 
is the root of your Lua config. 1 exception, when wrapRc = true, 
`stdpath('config')` will still point to ~/.config/<configDirName>.
But your lua config will be in the store.
This is ok, because most of the reason for a plugin to use
it would be to find something outside the directory. 
Inside is mostly handled by vim.
You can use debug.getinfo(1, "S").source:sub(2) or something similar 
to get current script directory for your uses, if ever necessary.
Keep in mind they will be read-only and theres definitely a more
in built vim way to do it.

*******************************************************
One IMPORTANT note:
When editing the files within the flake directory,
nix will not package a new file if it isn't staged in git.
run git add before rebuilding it whenever adding a new file.
Using wrapRc = true would mean this also applies to lua files.
In fact, when wrapRc = true, even changes within a lua file
will not be reflected unless you run git add.

the flake in your Lua, see:

Flake Inputs:                                            *nixCats.flake.inputs*

If they dont have an extra build step, 
name the plugins you import from github 
plugins-somepluginname 
They will be processed automatically into plugins by the default overlay.

If the plugin has a dot in it's name, you should name it something else.
The name here only affects the filename of the overall plugin, and should
only effect things like packadd. Usually I would replace it with - or _
You will then add it to categoryDefinitions later with the NEW name.

If they have a build step or are not a plugin, 
i.e. an lsp, dont name them in that format.

If they are on nixpkgs, you dont necessarily need to put them in inputs,
because you will be able to access them through pkgs.vimPlugins variable later.

Context for later:

If they have a build step, you will deal with them in overlays/customBuildsOverlay.nix
then import them into a category of the builder. 
(assuming nixpkgs hasn't already done it!!)

If they are not a plugin:
You will import them into a category of the builder under lspsAndDeps, 
unless they are for build time, then put them under propagatedBuildInputs

=======================================================================================
Flake Outputs Introduction                              *nixCats.flake.outputs*

With our inputs to our flake taken care of:

First, we call flake utils to get system variable for all default systems.

                                               *nixCats.flake.outputs.overlays*
Then, we define our overlays. They are in the overlays directory.
Thus, we can import that directory here,
which runs overlays/default.nix.
overlays/default.nix simply imports
a list of other overlays in the directory.
We have 2 main overlays to discuss.

<1>
-- The first is standardPluginOverlay:

This overlay is defined in full in overlays/standardPluginOverlay.nix.
You do not need to edit it to use it.

It takes all the inputs named in the format
'plugins-somepluginname' and makes them into plugins. 
If the plugin doesn't have a build step,
and it wasnt on nixpkgs, then use this method.
Access them to add them to a category of the builder function 
with 'pkgs.neovimPlugins.somepluginname'

<2>
-- The second is overlays/customBuildsOverlay.nix:

If you need to interact with one of these overlays, it will be this one.
You should not need to do it much. 
overlays/default.nix imports this overlay, 
and will return it along with the standard one.

It is used for defining plugins with build steps that 
were not well handled by nixpkgs.
It is passed flake inputs, and super is pkgs.
Define the things within the file. 
Then, access plugins defined there later 
with 'pkgs.customPlugins.somepluginname'

If you decide you wish to split your customBuildsOverlay up, add the new file
to the overlays directory then add a new line like
the following to overlays/default.nix, replacing the <indicated_text>:
>nix
    <some_name> = import ./<some_overlay_file.nix> inputs;

<pkgs>
-- After the overlays we wish to include are all defined:

We now generate the pkgs set that contains all the nixpkgs and overlay packages, 
and the system variable from flake-utils. If you imported any flakes with
overlays, add their overlay here as well.

pkgs will contain all our plugins and programs we will need from this point on.
with the occasional exception of a flake that has no overlays, which you just
add to a category directly.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Neovim Builder Creation:                        *nixCats.flake.outputs.builder*

We now create a builder function that takes 2 arguments.
A set of categories and a set of settings.

The settings set is defined in the next section. 
They did not make sense to include in the categories system.
see :help `nixCats.flake.outputs.settings`
They are then passed in as an argument when we call the builder we make.

The other argument, the set of categories,
is a set of named boolean values like this:
{ categoryname1 = true; categoryname2 = false; etc... }
It will tell us which categories to include per package.

To define this function that takes this set of categories and 
the settings as an argument, 
we import ./builder/default.nix and supply it the following.

1. The path to the help directory so that it is always included.
2. The path to the lua to include (in the flake, we use the self variable to get
     this path and wrap the lua when wrapRc = true)
3. The pkgs set so that it can use it for making its own derivations.
4. our set of categoryDefinitions.

And it will return a function that takes a set as an argument containing:
1. the set of settings
2. the set of included categories
>nix
  nixVimBuilder = import ./builder helpPath self pkgs categoryDefinitions;
  # notice how we provide it with the set we define below?
<

Then we define what is in our categories!
>nix
  categoryDefinitions = {
<
<-> a flexible set of categories, each containing a list of 
      internal BUILD TIME dependencies

<-> a flexible set of categories, each containing a list of LSP's or 
      other internal runtime dependencies such as ctags or debuggers
      these are available to the PATH while within neovim program.
      this includes the neovim terminal.

<-> a flexible set of categories, each containing a list of startup plugins.
      Startup plugins are loaded and can be required. 

<-> a flexible set of categories, each containing a list of optional plugins.
      Optional plugins need to be added with packadd before being required.

<-> a flexible set of categories, each containing an ATTRIBUTE SET of 
      EnvironmentVariableName = "EnvironmentVariableValue";

<-> a flexible set of categories, each containing a list of 
      extra wrapper arguments.
      If you don't know what that is, see here:
github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/build-support/setup-hooks/make-wrapper.sh

<-> 2 flexible sets of categories, one for python and the other for python3,
  each containing a list of FUNCTIONS that return lists of python packages.
  These functions are the same thing that you would pass to python.withPackages.

<-> a flexible set of categories, each containing a list of FUNCTIONS 
  that return lists of extra Lua packages.
  These functions are the same thing that you would pass to lua.withPackages.
}

how this function actually works is covered in 
:help `nixCats.flake.nixperts.nvimBuilder`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Settings Profiles:                             *nixCats.flake.outputs.settings*

These are the defaults:
>nix
  settings = {
    defaults = {
<
      # do you want to package the lua from this flake in the store?
      # or would you rather it just read it in your .config/<configDirName>?
      # nixCats and this help will work either way.
      # this value will also be included in nixCats.
>nix
      wrapRc = true;
<
      # What should the name of the folder within standard directories
      # i.e. .config, .local/share, .local/state, .cache, etc... be?
      # This option is very useful when you want 
      # to clone an unwrapped config straight to the .config dir.
      # see :help `$NVIM_APPNAME`
>nix
      configDirName = "nvim";

      # and the rest:
      viAlias = false;
      vimAlias = false;
      withNodeJs = false;
      withRuby = true;
      extraName = "";
      withPython3 = true;
    };
  };
<
If you wish to have something different, you may define some or all of these
options, in a set within the settings set to be included in the packaging section below.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package Generation:                           *nixCats.flake.outputs.packaging*

generate packages by calling that builder function we just created.
Place them in the packageDefinitions set.

First, pick the set of settings you wish to include.

Then, pass it a set of named boolean values like this:
{ categoryname1 = true; categoryname2 = false; etc... }
False may be omitted. True may not be omitted.
Only true matters for what plugins will be added.

These categories are defined in the Builder function above 
by placing named lists of plugins in the flexible sets provided.
The category names are the names of those lists. 
Add a new list, then enable the category here.

If you have categories with the same name in 
multiple different sets outlined above in the builder,
all plugins in those categories will be
included when you set "thatname = true;" here.
hence, general = true; will include the general lspsAndDeps category,
as well as the general startupPlugins category.

an example package definition:
>nix
  packageDefinitions = {
    nixCats = { 
      setting = settings.nixCats;
      categories = {
        custom = true;
        gitPlugins = true;
        general = true;
        neonixdev = true;

        # this does not have an associated category of plugins, 
        # but lua can still check for it
        lspDebugMode = false;

        # you could also pass something else and it calls 
        # builtins.toString on it and passes it in as a string
        theBestCat = "says meow!!!";
        # maybe you need to pass a port or path in or something idk.
        # you could :lua print(require('nixCats').theBestCat)
      };
    };
  };
<
You can require('nixCats') for the set you define here in your lua
It returns a lua table of the same format.

see :help `nixCats`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flake devShell and package definitions         *nixCats.flake.outputs.packages*

This will automatically add all of the packages in the 
packageDefinitions set defined in the section above.

However you still must choose your default packages
for packages, devShell, and overlays.

In addition, it defines a way for you to choose what
categories and settings are included in 
the flake that imports this flake, rather than choosing
a package you defined within the flake itself.
Exactly like :help `nixCats.flake.outputs.packaging`

This can be quite handy when you only need some things
from a flake you defined, 
but dont want to define a package in the flake for it.
This option is called with nixCats.customPackager.${system}

For this next section, these are related to:
:help `nixCats.flake.outputs.builder`

This flake defines 4 ways to create your own builder, but
within another flake that calls this one for even more options.
they are called:
customBuilders.${system}.fresh, merged, newLuaPath, and mergedNewLuaPath.

It also exposes standardPluginOverlay.${system} so that you
may use it within flakes that import this one.

Fresh has no nix categories defined. 
It is usually best used with wrapRc = false.

Merged has the categories you defined, but you can REDEFINE 
any category you wish or add new categories.

When using either of these, unless you have wrapRc = false 
it will recieve the flake's lua. There is a way
to add additional lua, but it is not recommended over editing the flake.
for more details on that, see :help `nixCats.flake.nixperts.nvimBuilder`

The last 2 ways to create your own builder do not recieve the flake's lua.

Instead, you must specify an absolute or store path (which includes the self
variable from another flake) to look in for when wrapRc == true.

Otherwise, they are the equivalent to the two above.

The order of arguments for these builder functions 
is the same as the regular one.

path: pkgs: categoryDefinitions: { settings, categories }:
